# The Subject: A Subject was any topic taught in the school, like Math, Science, History, etc. Each subject had

# # Student Model  -------------------

# Attendance Model (One-to-One Relationship)

# number of days a student was present was recorded here.

# many students could be enrolled in that class. The teacher taught them the subjects, and the class helped 
# organize their learning experience.

# Enrollment Model (Many-to-Many Relationship)
# Enrollment: Students didnâ€™t just learn randomly; they were Enrolled in subjects. Each Enrollment captured which 
# student was enrolled in which subject, and the date they began their enrollment. This many-to-many relationship 
# helped track all the subjects each student was involved with and when they started.
class Enrollment(models.Model):
    student = models.ForeignKey(Student, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

        return f"{self.student.name} - {', '.join([subject.name for subject in self.subjects.all()])}"


# How It All Works Together
# The Parents are associated with Students, providing necessary contact information.
# Teachers teach Subjects and manage their respective Classes. A teacher could teach multiple subjects.
# Students have a grade, and they are enrolled in multiple subjects. Their attendance is tracked individually.
# The Attendance model ensures that each student's presence is accurately recorded.
# The Enrollment model tracks when a student first enrolled in a subject, creating a relationship between the student and their academic journey.
